# ndc-hub

This repository provides a Rust crate to aid development of [Hasura Native Data Connectors](https://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/). Developers can implement a trait, and derive an executable which can be used to run a connector which is compatible with the specification.

In addition, this library adopts certain conventions which are not covered by the current specification:

- Connector configuration
- State management
- Trace collection

## Getting started

```sh
cargo build
```

## Run the example connector

```sh
cargo run --bin ndc_hub_example -- \
  --configuration <(echo 'null')
```

Inspect the resulting (empty) schema:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8100/schema
```

(the default port 8100 can be changed using `--port`)
